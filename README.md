# A Dynamic Weighted Tabular Method for Convolutional Neural Networks
The Dynamic Weighted Tabular Method is a novel technique for applying Convolutional Neural Networks on tabular data. The method uses statistical techniques to compute the relevance of the features to the class. Based on the relevance/importance level of the features they are assigned pixel positions in the image. The features receive image canvas space based on the ratio of their importance to the class. The images are then fed into CNNs for classification.
